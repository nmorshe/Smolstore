This is a mock E-store application built with the use of Next.js, FantaCSS, and connected to a Stripe API.

This was made as part of an online coursework project to immerse myself into Next.js and understand more about full stack development.

This project was mainly created via the use of Next.js development packages, VS Code, and connections to the Stripe API. It consists of elements
and hooks created through react libraries, as well as logo designs from FontAwesome. Now published on AWS Amplify
